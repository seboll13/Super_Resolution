\begin{abstract}
    Super-resolution is the tool that fundamentally allows us to increase the resolution of low resolution images. The original problem has both a practical and a theoretical meaning, the latter in which we wish to recover a superposition of point sources on a $d$-dimensional plane having merely access to bandlimited Fourier measurements. The goal of this project is to study a recent paper on theoretical super-resolution and discuss the main procedure that aims at recovering a collection of source points on a plane. Ultimately, some intuition will be presented on how the procedure could be improved such that its sample complexity is reduced.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to take the opportunity to thank the people that contributed in some way to the progression of this project. First of all, my thanks go to my project supervisor Prof. Michael Kapralov who suggested me this very interesting paper and who supervised all my work during this semester. He managed to push me in some way to give the very best of me and even though theory is hard, I would without hesitation do this again. I would also like to express my gratitude to my co-supervisor Navid Nouri who supported me from the very begining of the project and who gave me some very helpful advice all along. Finally, I would like to thank Kshiteej Sheth and Mikhail Makarov for some very interesting discussions towards the end of the project.

    In theory, theory and practice are the same. In practice, they are not.
