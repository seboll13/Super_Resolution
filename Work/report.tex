\begin{abstract}
    Super-resolution is the tool that allows us to increase the resolution of images. In a more theoretical sense, it allows us to recover fine details of an object given merely access to coarse measurements of it. The fine details will often be a collection of image source points that contain critical information in the time domain, whereas the coarse measurements will be their noisy equivalence in the frequency domain. If we for example wish to perform an MRI scan of a patient, we can consider we will have access to some Fourier measurements that we will use to recover an estimate of the original signal. The problem of super-resolving a noisy signal therefore has both a practical and a theoretical application. The goal of this project is to study a recent paper on theoretical super-resolution and discuss the main procedure that aims at recovering a collection of source points on a multi-dimensional plane. Ultimately, some intuition will be presented on how the procedure could be improved such that its sample complexity is reduced.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to take the opportunity to thank the people that contributed in some way to the progression of this project. First of all, my thanks go to my project supervisor Prof. Michael Kapralov who suggested me this very interesting paper and who supervised all my work during this semester. He managed to push me in some way to give the very best of me and even though theory is hard, I would without hesitation do this again. I would also like to express my gratitude to my co-supervisor Navid Nouri who supported me from the very begining of the project and gave me some very helpful advice all along including some on writing a good, short and concise report. Finally, I would like to thank Kshiteej Sheth and Mikhail Makarov for some very interesting discussions towards the end of the project.
