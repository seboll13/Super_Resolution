The goal of this project was to familiarise myself with a topic called super-resolution by reading a recent paper on the subject. The paper in question called "Super resolution off the grid" that was written in 2015 by Qingqing Huang and Sham Kakade highlighted an algorithm that is capable to efficiently recover the location of some spikes of a low resolution image.\par
