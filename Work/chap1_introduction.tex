\chapter{Introduction}
With the increasing amount of data nowadays, it has become extremely important to develop tools that allow us to treat it better. In the case of images, unfortunately a lot of them are still taken with technology that still misses some important information. Recently, a new theory called super-resolution has emerged. Its aim is to, given access to some coarse measurements, recover estimates of some point sources located in a $d$-dimensional plane.\par 

The paper we will study here is called "Super-Resolution Off the Grid" and has been published by Qingqing Huang and Sham M. Kakade in September 2015. From a theoretical point of view, super-resolution is the problem of recovering a superposition of point sources using (noise corrupted) bandlimited measurements. In essence, suppose we are given a collection of points that lie on the $d$-dimensional plane, to which we have no access whatsoever. We use measurements from the Fourier domain and super-resolve the point sources so that the estimates we get are the best possible ones.\par 

The goal of this project is to get familiar with the theory of super-resolution along with all important mathematical preliminaries and study the main result presented in the above mentioned paper. The idea is then to compare this work with other related ones and discuss the efficiency of the main algorithm. Ultimately, it would be a nice addition to start working on an improvement of the main algorithm in order to reduce the sample complexity from quadratic space to the information theoretical linear one.
